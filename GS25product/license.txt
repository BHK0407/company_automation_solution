Company-POS Auto-Setup
CopyRight by Khang Bui

This project helps automate the first-time setup of a 
Windows-based Point of Sale (POS) terminal after a 
fresh install. It takes care of things like setting the IP 
address, creating POS users, renaming the compute, 
tweaking the taskbar, and turning off those annoying 
first sign-in prompts â€” basically speeding up the boring 
setup stuff so you can move on to the real work faster.
